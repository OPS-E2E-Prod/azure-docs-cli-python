## Prepare your environment

1. Do a [local install](install-azure-cli.md) of the Azure CLI or start [Azure Cloud Shell](start-azure-cloud-shell.md) to run Azure CLI commands.

1. Sign in using the [az login](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login) command if you're using a local install.  Follow the steps displayed in your terminal to complete the authentication process.  See [Sign in with Azure CLI](authenticate-azure-cli.md) for additional sign in options.
1. If you don't have a resource group, create one using the [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) command.  See [What is Azure Resource Manager](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview) to learn more about resource groups.
