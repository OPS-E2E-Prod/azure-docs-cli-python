If you decide to uninstall the Azure CLI, we're sorry to see you go. Before you uninstall, use the `az feedback` command to give
some information about why you chose to uninstall and how the CLI could be improved. Our goal is to make the Azure
CLI bug-free and user-friendly. If you encountered a bug, we'd appreciate it if you [file a GitHub issue](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues).
