1. Run the `login` command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az login
    ```

    If the CLI can determine your default browser and has access to open it, it will do so and direct you
    immediately to a sign in page.

    Otherwise, you need to open a browser page and follow the instructions on the command line to enter an
    authorization code after navigating to [https://aka.ms/devicelogin](https://aka.ms/devicelogin) in your browser.

2. Sign in with your account credentials in the browser.
