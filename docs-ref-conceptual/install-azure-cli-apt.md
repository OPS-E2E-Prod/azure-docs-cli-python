# Install Azure CLI 2.0 with apt

If you are running a distribution that comes with `apt`, such as Ubuntu or Debian, there is a 64-bit package available
for the Azure CLI. This package has been tested with:

* Ubuntu trusty, xenial, and artful
* Debian wheezy, jessie, and stretch

## Install

1. Modify your sources list:

     ```bash
     AZ_REPO=$(lsb_release -cs)
     echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/azure-cli/ $AZ_REPO main" | \
          sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/azure-cli.list
     ```

2. <a name="signingKey"></a>Get the Microsoft signing key:

   ```bash
   curl -L https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | sudo apt-key add -
   ```

3. Install the CLI:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install azure-cli
   ```

   > [!WARNING]
   > The signing key was updated in May 2018, and has been replaced. If you receive
   > signing key errors, please ensure that you have [acquired the latest signing key](#signingKey).

You can then run the Azure CLI with the `az` command. To log in, run the `az login` command.

```azurecli
az login
```

To learn more about different login methods, see [Log in with Azure CLI 2.0](authenticate-azure-cli.md).

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common problems seen when installing with `apt`. If your issue is not listed here, please [file an issue on github](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues).

### lsb_release fails with "Command not found"

When running the `lsb_release` command, you may see output similar to the following error:

```output
-bash: lsb_release: command not found
```

The error is due to lsb_release not being installed. You can resolve it by installing the `lsb-release` package.

```bash
sudo apt-get install lsb-release
```

### apt-key fails with "No dirmngr"

When running the `apt-key` command, you may see output similar to the following error:

```output
gpg: failed to start the dirmngr '/usr/bin/dirmngr': No such file or directory
gpg: connecting dirmngr at '/tmp/apt-key-gpghome.kt5zo27tp1/S.dirmngr' failed: No such file or directory
gpg: keyserver receive failed: No dirmngr
```

The error is due to a missing component required by `apt-key`. You can resolve it by installing the `dirmngr` package.

```bash
sudo apt-get install dirmngr
```

### apt-key hangs

When behind a firewall blocking outgoing connections to port 11371, the `apt-key` command might hang indefinitely. Your firewall may require the use of an HTTP proxy for outgoing connections:

```bash
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver-options http-proxy=http://<USER>:<PASSWORD>@<PROXY-HOST>:<PROXY-PORT>/ --keyserver packages.microsoft.com --recv-keys 52E16F86FEE04B979B07E28DB02C46DF417A0893
```

If you do not know if you have a proxy, contact your system administrator. If your proxy does not require a login then leave out the user, password, and `@` token.

## Update

Use `apt-get upgrade` to update the CLI package.

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
   ```

> [!WARNING]
> The signing key was updated in May 2018, and has been replaced. If you receive
> signing key errors, please ensure that you have [acquired the latest signing key](#signingKey).
   
> [!NOTE]
> This command upgrades all of the installed packages on your system that have not had a dependency change.
> To upgrade the CLI only, use `apt-get install`.
> ```bash
> sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install --only-upgrade -y azure-cli
> ```

## Uninstall

[!INCLUDE [uninstall-boilerplate.md](includes/uninstall-boilerplate.md)]

1. Uninstall with `apt-get remove`.

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get remove -y azure-cli
    ```

2. If you do not plan to reinstall the CLI, remove the Azure CLI repository information.

   ```bash
   sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/azure-cli.list
   ```

3. Remove any unneeded packages.

   ```bash
   sudo apt autoremove
   ```
